            Add in coffee, butter, dark chocolate and heat it gently 
            till it is melted. Add in sugar and whisk well till it is 
            completely melted.

            Add in one egg at a time and whisk it well. Add in the sifted flour 
            mix in and mix well to a smooth batter. </li>
            <li>Pour this in the prepared pan and pop it in
